# 👋 Hi, I'm Wojciech Jędrzejczyk!

I've just started my programming journey and I'm currently learning **Python**. I work in a different industry, but programming has always fascinated me, and I want to master it.

## 🚀 My Projects

### 🔥 OSPGuard
An application that supports fire departments in monitoring deadlines for periodic medical examinations and training. I'm using:
- **Python**
- **SQLite** for database management
- **Wagtail** for interface handling

### 🌍 MUD with Evennia
In my free time, I'm developing my own MUD game based on the **Evennia** framework, blending classic MUD experiences with modern features.

## 💼 Skills
- **Python** (currently learning)
- **Git** (version control)

## 🎯 Goals
- Grow as a programmer, exploring new technologies
- Complete projects like OSPGuard and my MUD with Evennia

*And the road leads on and on
Although it began just beyond the threshold –
And into the distance in front of me it rushes to the east,
And I still follow it – as best I can…
With eager feet in its wake –
Until it dissolves into a wider road,
Where the stream of numerous roads has already flowed…
And then where? – I cannot say.*
